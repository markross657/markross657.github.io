    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            The project I am going to outline over the next few paragraphs is one that I am currently already working on in my spare time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is a budget management WebApp, which allows a user to enter all of their incomes and expenses, each with a Start Date, Frequency, Value and Title/Name.<br>
            From there the user will be able to view their budget on a Weekly, Fortnightly or Monthly scale, with the landing page providing a summary for the incoming and outgoing values of each Pay Cycle.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was inspired as I was previously using google calendars Schedule view to know which bills were coming out of my accounts each week, but found that this was an imperfect system and lacked a lot of functionality that I was looking for.<br>
            After hunting around to see if I could find an application that would let me do what i was looking for, I found a void in the marketplace as far as Web/Mobile apps go and decided to develop the application for my own use and portfolio.<br>
        </p>
    <h2>Project Outline:</h2>
        <p>The budget app which I plan on developing will have several major functionalities, as outlined below:</p>
        <h3>Income / Expenses</h3>
        <p>
            The app will allow users to enter their incomes and expenses which will include a Name / Title, Value, Frequency and Starting Date.<br>
            The incomes and expenses will be able to be allocated against a bank account that the user enters, which will also have a Name, BSB and AccNo.
        </p>
        <h3>Simple Period Review</h3>
        <p>
            The application will allow users to see a general overview of their budget state on either a Weekly, Fortnightly or Monthly scale.<br>
            This will have a basic outline of how much money is coming in and out over that pay period at a quick glance.<br>
            From this page the user will also have a basic breakdown of what type of expenses are taking up which percentage of income mapped out into a pie chart for quick readability.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Detailed Period Review</h3>
        <p>
            The  Detailed Period Review will show the user a breakdown of the exact income and expenses for that pay period.<br>
            The focus of this screen will be lower level details, allowing the user to know exactly where their income is from that week,<br>
            if they should have more than one source of income, and exactly which bills will be coming out of which bank accounts in that time period.<br>
            Again under this view the user will be able to see a breakdown entry by entry of the percentage breakdown allocated out to each entry.<br>
            For example, If a user has two incomes for that pay period, one is $400, one is $600, Income 1 will be listed as “Income1 - $400 - 40%”.
        </p>
        <h3>Calendar Budget Review</h3>
        <p>
            The calendar period review screen will display to the user in a similar fashion to the Google Calendar ‘Schedule’ page,<br>
            with the user being able to scroll down the list through the Weeks to see upcoming bills and payments that are due in the weeks to come.<br>
            This view will focus on fairly high level details, and will not display things like percentage breakdown.<br>
            The user will have the ability to drill down into a detailed view of any one week / pay period to see a detailed period review for that time period.
        </p>
    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            It is in early stages of research for the tools and technologies although at this point it is looking like Angular<br>
            will be the framework used as it is versatile enough that I can utilise the same back end for both the Desktop and mobile platform,<br>
            and will just have to modify the front end to suit the platform.<br>
            As far as the hardware is concerned I will require the Desktop/Laptop to develop both the User Interfaces, Front and Back end.<br>
            With the mobile platform I will require several iOS devices with various screen resolutions (iPhone Max, iPhone Standard,<br>
            Differing generations of both). I will also need to test across various android platforms, although they are slightly more uniform in their screen resolutions.
        </p>
    <h2>Skills Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The skill requirement will be for me to learn the Angular framework to a competent level,<br>
            as well as basic knowledge of building and designing User Interfaces.<br>
            From preliminary research it looks like the focus will be on using the AngularDart framework as i already<br>
            have a fairly decent level of understanding and competency with C#.<br>
            As most of the early stage testing on many platforms is to use a service like <a href="https://www.lambdatest.com">Lambatest.</a><br>
            Further down the road closer to taking the Application live, we would need to source actual devices to test on.
        </p>
    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            Should the project be successful not only would I of managed to provide myself with a product that i’ve been wanting for some time,<br>
            I would have also managed to add a valuable asset to my portfolio, increasing the likelihood of myself finding employment in a field which I have a lot of interest in.
