    <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
    <p>
    An ad posting for my ideal job can be found <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39873697?searchrequesttoken=fae3735b-8c75-43fc-b02a-39bb07c541fc&type=standard">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        As my knowledge and experience grows as I progress through the Bachelor i have a growing interest in Webapp / Mobile App development.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The job advertised is looking for a developer utilising .Net (C#) and Angular to create complete products for their clients.<br>
        This appeals to me as I am most confident and comfortable with C#, and have a keen interest in Angular as i have only recently started dabbling with it.<br>
        This position will require someone confident with both front end technologies including UI Design, Angular, .Net and HTML/CSS.<br>
        As this is a senior position is somewhere I want to end up with after a few years post graduation.<br>
        At this point i have basic level knowledge of all things the job posting is asking for - So as far as following the path to ending up in a position like this,<br>
        it will be a case of continual learning and practice of the current skills I have.<br>
        At this point i have very limited knowledge, understanding and experience with Windows Servers and Databases (SQL).<br>
        This will need to be one of my main focusâ€™ in the short term to establish myself with a basic foundation to build upon.
