    <h1>Personality Profile</h1>
    <p>
        I have previously done these tests many times - So the results were not shocking or surprising at all.<br>
        I have gotten the same results many times over.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have worked on developing the weaker points of my personality over many years, the biggest of which is my inability<br>
        to sympathise with those more driven by emotion rather than logic.<br>
        When working with a team I often have to pull myself up to be more patient with others who might have a slower or different approach to the one i have decided upon myself.
