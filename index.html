    <p>
        I am a 30 year old Australian who has a passion for programming.<br>
        I can’t say being Australian with a heavy english background has any form of ‘culture’ outside of binge drinking on weekends over a good old Bunnings Snag,<br>
        but I’m sure there are plenty who disagree.

        My Hobbies are wide ranging, including Programming (obviously), Game Design, Live Music, and Harley Davidsons.<br>
        An Interesting fact about me is that I was lucky enough to open for The Amity Affliction with my old band as part of their ‘Youngbloods’ tour

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>
        My interest in IT started out in my early teenage years when myself and friends started doing game development using GameMaker v4.<br>
        From there I found enjoyment in the problem solving process of programming and designing systems.<br>
        My experience in IT is mostly self taught when it comes to software and programming.<br>
        Prior to starting the Bachelor of IT I had taught myself the basics in HTML, CSS, Visual Basic, QBasic (showing my age), as well as C# via the Unity3D Engine.
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose RMIT via Open Universities Australia as the Bachelor of IT seemed to cover the widest range of topics vs doing something like a CompSci degree.<br>
        As my experience is self taught i had a wide range of gaps in my knowledge and because of that was unsure on which avenues of IT<br>
        i wanted to build a career in, just that i wanted to focus on a career in IT in general.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the course I am hoping to be able to solidify my abilities as well as find a direction to focus my efforts and build a career.<br>
        So far I am approaching the half way mark of the Bachelor, and am finding an ever growing interest in programming, specifically focusing on WebDev and App Development.
